# League Patch Collection – Vanguard Disabler & QOL Optimizer for League Client

**League Patch Collection** is a lightweight C# application designed for Windows to enhance your League of Legends experience. This tool introduces several quality-of-life features and optimizations League Client experience. See command line arguments additional options.

>  Unlike most third party tools, this app does NOT use the Riot Client or LCU api. Instead it hooks into backend protocals like XMPP (chat), Websocket (RMS) and https (Ledge).

## Features

By default, this app provides the following enhancements:
- :white_check_mark: **Chat Restriction Bypass**: Allows you to use champion select and post-game chat even if you are blocked due to having Honor Level 1.
- :white_check_mark: **Vanguard Disabler**: Access full functionality of the League Client and use Kbot without risk of being banned. Usefull if you want to safely debug the client.
- :white_check_mark: **Disable Store**: Greys out store button and prevents popups and nags related to in-game purchases.
- :white_check_mark: **Legacy Honor**: Restores the old post game honor screen pre patch 14.19 where you can only only one teammate. Honoring enemies is cringe.
- :white_check_mark: **Log Cleaner**: Clean all client and account logs with the click of a button.
- :white_check_mark: **Name Change Bypass**: Bypasses forced name change/Riot id required screens.
- :white_check_mark: **Appear offline**: Option to mask your status to appear offline to your friends list. They cannot invite you, however, you can still invite them. You can also mask your status to show as Riot Mobile as well.
- :white_check_mark: **Hawolt ban bypass**: Proof of concept exploit that may or may not actually work, basically this will block RMS session notifications delaying the amount of time it takes for session to expire. [More info](https://web.archive.org/web/20230628125118/https://twitter.com/hawolt/status/1674029547363217410) about this exploit.
- :white_check_mark: **Removal of Bloatware**: Removes the Legends of Runeterra (LoR) button, Info Hub and suppresses some behavior warnings (ranked restrictions and so on). Also makes the patch number show in old format (ex: 15.3 instead of 25.S1 fomart). **This also disables Sanctum**.
- :white_check_mark: **Streamlined Interface**: Eliminates promotions and other unnecessary clutter from the client. 
- :white_check_mark: **Ban Reason Fix**: Resolves issues where the ban reason doesn't display on certain accounts, fixing the infinite loading/unknown player bug.
- :white_check_mark: **Enhanced Privacy**: Disables all tracking and telemetry services, including Sentry, to reduce tracking and prevent unnecessary background activity.
- :white_check_mark: **Home Hub Fix**: Fixes home hubs taking longer than usual to load issue.

## Pull requests needed

Pull requests are always welcome. Also, if anyone knows a library or easy way to decode Riot's rtmp (they use action message format) please contact me **c4t_bot** on Discord. I cannot find any c# libraries for decoding AMF0, AMF3 which is needed to proxy RTMP for lobby revealer. For reference here is a [good article](https://web-xbaank.vercel.app/blog/Reversing-engineering-lol) that describes how a lobby revealer works.
